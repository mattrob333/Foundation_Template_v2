## üìã Simplified Research Workflow

### Phase 1: Discovery Enhancement
Using existing tools to gather comprehensive data:

```markdown
1. Web Search for Company Basics
   - @web search "{{COMPANY_NAME}} company information"
   - @web search "{{COMPANY_NAME}} leadership team"
   - @web search "{{COMPANY_NAME}} funding history"

2. Firecrawl Deep Scraping
   - @mcp firecrawl_map to discover all pages
   - @mcp firecrawl_batch_scrape key pages:
     - Homepage
     - About page
     - Team/Leadership
     - Products/Services
     - Customers/Case Studies
     - Careers page

3. Structured Extraction
   - @mcp firecrawl_extract with schemas for:
     - Product information
     - Leadership profiles
     - Customer testimonials
     - Technology mentions
```

### Phase 2: Market Intelligence
Combining search and scraping for insights:

```markdown
1. Recent Developments
   - @web search "{{COMPANY_NAME}} news 2024"
   - @web search "{{COMPANY_NAME}} press releases"
   - @mcp firecrawl_scrape news articles

2. Competitive Analysis
   - @web search "{{COMPANY_NAME}} competitors"
   - @web search "{{COMPANY_NAME}} vs alternatives"
   - @mcp firecrawl_search for comparison data

3. Industry Context
   - @web search "{{INDUSTRY}} trends 2024"
   - @web search "{{INDUSTRY}} market size"
   - Extract relevant insights
```

### Phase 3: Technology Profiling
Using job postings and public information:

```markdown
1. Technology Stack Discovery
   - @web search "{{COMPANY_NAME}} jobs developer"
   - @mcp firecrawl_scrape careers page
   - Extract technology keywords from job posts

2. Digital Footprint Analysis
   - @mcp firecrawl_scrape developer docs (if available)
   - @web search "{{COMPANY_NAME}} API documentation"
   - @web search "{{COMPANY_NAME}} technology stack"
```

## üöÄ Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Update Discovery Workflow
Enhance the existing discovery workflow to use Firecrawl:

```python
# Instead of manual web searches, use:
@mcp firecrawl_scrape url="{{COMPANY_URL}}"
@mcp firecrawl_map url="{{COMPANY_URL}}"
@mcp firecrawl_batch_scrape urls=[discovered_urls]
```

### Step 2: Create Research Templates
Pre-built queries for common research needs:

```markdown
## Company Research Template
1. Basic Information
   - firecrawl_scrape: Homepage
   - firecrawl_extract: Company facts

2. Leadership Research
   - web search: "CEO founder LinkedIn"
   - firecrawl_scrape: Team page

3. Product Research
   - firecrawl_batch_scrape: All product pages
   - firecrawl_extract: Product features and pricing

4. Market Position
   - web search: Recent news
   - firecrawl_search: Competitor mentions
```

### Step 3: Batch Processing
Process multiple companies efficiently:

```markdown
## Batch Research Process
1. Create company list with URLs
2. For each company:
   - Run firecrawl_map to discover pages
   - Batch scrape top 10 pages
   - Extract structured data
   - Search for recent news
3. Compile results in standardized format
```
