# /foundation_complete
End-to-end Foundation creation in one workflow

## Prerequisites
- Foundation template downloaded and opened
- 2-4 hours available
- Company URL or basic information

## Master Workflow Execution

### Phase 1: Initialize (5 min)
```
Get input:
Ask: "What's the company website URL or LinkedIn?"
Store: {{COMPANY_URL}}

If no URL:
Ask: "Company name and what they do?"

Update file: foundation.config.yaml
- Set company name
- Set industry (preliminary)
- Set website
```

### Phase 2: Discovery (20 min)
```
Execute: /01_discovery workflow

Checkpoints:
✓ Company overview populated
✓ Employee count identified
✓ Industry confirmed
✓ Recent news captured
```

### Phase 3: Classification (10 min)
```
Execute: /02_classification workflow

Checkpoints:
✓ Archetype determined
✓ Next level goal defined
✓ Success metrics set
✓ Focus areas clear
```

### Phase 4: Structure Creation (10 min)
```
Execute: /03_structure_creation workflow

Checkpoints:
✓ Archetype template applied
✓ 15-25 files created
✓ Proper headers added
✓ File inventory complete
```

### Phase 5: Agent Generation (20 min)
```
Execute: /04_agent_generation workflow

Checkpoints:
✓ All 4 agents customized
✓ Agents know their file structure
✓ Industry-specific language
✓ Transformation focus
```

### Phase 6: Research Population (60 min)
```
Execute: /05_research_population workflow

Checkpoints:
✓ High priority files populated first
✓ All agents have knowledge
✓ Cross-references added
✓ Research summary created
```

### Phase 7: Final Validation (10 min)
```
Test complete system:

1. Configuration Test:
   - Check foundation.config.yaml has all fields
   - Verify no [PLACEHOLDER] text remains

2. Agent Knowledge Test:
   @ATLAS "What's our biggest opportunity?"
   @NAVIGATOR "What should we measure?"
   @MAESTRO "What tech do we need?"
   @CATALYST "What change challenges exist?"

3. Cross-Agent Test:
   @ATLAS @NAVIGATOR @MAESTRO @CATALYST 
   "How do we achieve {{NEXT_LEVEL_GOAL}}?"

Expected: Each agent provides specific, coordinated insights
```

### Phase 8: Delivery Package (5 min)
```
Create final deliverables:

1. Update main README.md with:
   - Company-specific information
   - Key insights discovered
   - Recommended first questions
   - Next steps

2. Create: FOUNDATION_COMPLETE.md

```

## Troubleshooting Checkpoints

### After Each Phase:
- Save all work (Cmd/Ctrl + S)
- Verify no errors in console
- Check files were created/updated
- Confirm no placeholder text remains

### If Workflow Fails:
1. Note which phase failed
2. Check last successful step
3. Restart from that phase
4. Common issues:
   - Web search timeout → Retry with simpler query
   - File not found → Check path spelling
   - Agent can't see files → Check YAML headers

### Quality Gates:
**Must Pass Before Proceeding:**
- Phase 2 → Company overview complete
- Phase 3 → Next level goal defined
- Phase 4 → Agents respond intelligently
- Phase 5 → File structure matches archetype
- Phase 6 → Priority files have content

## Time Management

**If Limited Time (2 hours):**
- Phase 1-4: Complete fully (55 min)
- Phase 5: Skip, create structure only
- Phase 6: Populate top 5 files only
- Mark remaining as [TODO]

**Standard Time (3 hours):**
- All phases as described
- Focus on quality over quantity
- Populate high/medium priority files

**Extended Time (4 hours):**
- All phases complete
- All files populated
- Deep research on key areas
- Enhanced cross-references

Remember: An 80% complete Foundation that's actively used beats a perfect one that sits idle.
