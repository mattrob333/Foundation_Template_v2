## Key Strategic Questions

### 1. Microsoft Loop & Google Competition
**Question**: How will Notion defend against Microsoft Loop's enterprise integration advantages?

**My Analysis**: 
- Microsoft's bundling strategy poses significant threat
- Notion must emphasize flexibility and user experience
- Partner ecosystem critical for competing with suite offerings
- AI differentiation becoming table stakes, not competitive advantage

### 2. International Expansion Strategy
**Question**: With 80% of users international, how should Notion prioritize geographic expansion?

**My Analysis**:
- Europe: GDPR compliance and data residency critical
- Asia: Localization beyond translation needed
- Enterprise features must adapt to regional compliance
- Local competitor analysis shows opportunity in APAC

### 3. Platform vs Product Strategy
**Question**: Should Notion remain a flexible platform or verticalize into specific use cases?

**My Analysis**:
- Current flexibility is key differentiator
- But enterprise buyers want packaged solutions
- Recommendation: Maintain platform core with vertical templates
- Partner ecosystem can provide specialization
