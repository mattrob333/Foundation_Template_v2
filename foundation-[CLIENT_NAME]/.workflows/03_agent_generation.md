### Step 5: Create Enhanced Company Overview

Combine all insights into: `shared_context/enhanced_company_overview.md`

This file will be the input to the meta-prompt creator. It should include:
- All sections from company_overview.md
- Classification insights
- Next level goals
- Industry intelligence
- Technology landscape
- Leadership culture

### Step 6: Run Meta-Prompt Creator

```
Input the contents of enhanced_company_overview.md into the meta-prompt creator.

The meta-prompt will generate exactly 4 agent blocks with:
- Company-specific customization
- Industry-appropriate language
- Next-level focus
- Proper formatting
```

### Step 7: Post-Process Generated Agents

For each generated agent:

1. **Verify Customization**
   - Uses company name (not [CLIENT_NAME])
   - References specific industry
   - Mentions actual challenges
   - Focuses on next-level goals

2. **Enhance Questions Section**
   Based on calibration, ensure "Key Questions I Always Ask" includes:
   - Questions from calibration doc
   - Industry-specific questions
   - Stage-appropriate questions
   - Transformation-focused questions

3. **Adjust Communication Style**
   - Match company culture (formal/casual)
   - Use industry terminology
   - Reference company values
   - Appropriate sophistication level

### Step 8: Save Final Agent Files

Save each agent to:
- `.agents/ATLAS.md`
- `.agents/NAVIGATOR.md`
- `.agents/MAESTRO.md`
- `.agents/CATALYST.md`

Each file should have proper YAML header and follow the template structure.

### Step 9: Validate Agent Quality

Run test queries to ensure agents are properly calibrated:

```
@ATLAS "What should {{COMPANY_NAME}} focus on to {{NEXT_LEVEL_GOAL}}?"
Expected: Specific strategic recommendations, not generic advice

@NAVIGATOR "How can {{COMPANY_NAME}} improve {{KEY_METRIC}}?"
Expected: Operational insights specific to their situation

@MAESTRO "What technology should {{COMPANY_NAME}} prioritize?"
Expected: Tech recommendations aligned with their maturity

@CATALYST "What change challenges will {{COMPANY_NAME}} face?"
Expected: Change insights specific to their culture/stage
```

### Step 10: Agent Quality Checklist

Rate each agent 1-10 on:
- [ ] **Specificity**: Uses company-specific context
- [ ] **Relevance**: Focused on next-level goals  
- [ ] **Expertise**: Demonstrates industry knowledge
- [ ] **Actionability**: Provides clear guidance
- [ ] **Differentiation**: Not generic AI responses

If any score < 7, return to calibration and enhance.

### Step 11: Create Agent Summary

Create: `.agents/AGENT_SUMMARY.md`

```markdown

## Critical Success Factors

1. **Agents Must Sound Like Real Advisors**
   - Not "I can help with..." but "You should focus on..."
   - Not generic but specific to their situation
   - Not theoretical but practical and actionable

2. **Next Level Focus is Everything**
   - Every agent recommendation should move toward the goal
   - Skip anything not relevant to transformation
   - Time horizon: 12-18 months

3. **Industry Language Matters**
   - SaaS: ARR, churn, CAC/LTV
   - Manufacturing: OEE, throughput, quality
   - Healthcare: outcomes, compliance, interop
   - Use the words they use

## Time Estimate: 20-30 minutes

This is the most critical workflow - take time to get it right!
