## Recalibration Process

### Step 1: Assess Technology Shift
```markdown
Technology Assessment:
- Current Stack: [LIST_TECHNOLOGIES]
- Planned Changes: [MIGRATIONS/ADDITIONS]
- Maturity Movement: [FROM] → [TO]
- Business Impact: [DESCRIBE]
```

### Step 2: Update Core Parameters
1. **Revise tech maturity level**
2. **Adjust architecture classification**
3. **Update build vs buy preference**
4. **Recalibrate innovation stance**

### Step 3: Update MAESTRO Persona
Edit `.agents/MAESTRO.md`:
- Modify technology philosophy
- Update architectural preferences
- Adjust technical language/complexity
- Revise tool recommendations

### Step 4: Refresh Knowledge Base
Priority files to update:
1. `MAESTRO/tech_stack/current_technology.md`
2. `MAESTRO/architecture/target_architecture.md`
3. `MAESTRO/talent/skills_matrix.md`
