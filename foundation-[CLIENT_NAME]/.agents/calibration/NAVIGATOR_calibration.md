## Recalibration Process

### Step 1: Assess Operational Change
```markdown
Operational Assessment:
- Performance Baseline: [METRICS]
- Current Performance: [METRICS]
- Gap Analysis: [DELTA]
- Root Causes: [LIST]
```

### Step 2: Update Core Parameters
1. **Adjust maturity classification**
2. **Revise optimization priorities**
3. **Update measurement approach**
4. **Recalibrate efficiency targets**

### Step 3: Update NAVIGATOR Persona
Edit `.agents/NAVIGATOR.md`:
- Modify operational philosophy
- Update KPI priorities
- Adjust complexity of recommendations
- Revise benchmark references

### Step 4: Refresh Knowledge Base
Priority files to update:
1. `NAVIGATOR/metrics/operational_kpis.md`
2. `NAVIGATOR/operations/process_optimization.md`
3. `NAVIGATOR/scaling/capacity_planning.md`
4. `NAVIGATOR/sales_marketing/funnel_metrics.md`

### Step 5: Validate Calibration
Test queries:
```
@NAVIGATOR "What's our biggest operational bottleneck?"
@NAVIGATOR "How do we improve [METRIC] by [X]%?"
@NAVIGATOR "What processes should we automate first?"
```

Expected: Responses reflect current operational reality
